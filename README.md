## Project Reasoning

- This project addresses the critical business challenge of accurately predicting the cost of individual insurance claims using data mining techniques. The primary motivation is to build an accurate predictive model for financial forecasting, and to conduct an explanatory study to definitively identify the quantitative drivers of claim costs.

Data Selection: We utilize the Kaggle Insurance Claim Prediction dataset, which offers real-world features (age, BMI, children, smoker status, region) necessary for a meaningful predictive study.

Methodology & Goals: Our approach employs Multiple Linear Regression to quantify the influence of demographic and personal factors on the claim amount. We will use Feature Selection to isolate the variables that explain the maximum variation in cost. The success of the final model will be rigorously validated by measuring its predictive accuracy for new members using the statistical metric $R^2$ (Coefficient of Determination), thereby moving beyond simple prediction toward detailed, actionable insights.
